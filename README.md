This project analyzes the carbon footprint of products across industries using SQL. It calculates total emissions per industry and identifies top contributing companies.

## Data
The `product_emissions` table (PostgreSQL) contains product carbon footprints (PCFs) and production stage emissions. Key columns include: `year`, `product_name`, `company`, `industry_group`, `carbon_footprint_pcf`.

## Objective
Examine and rank industries based on total carbon footprint using SQL.
